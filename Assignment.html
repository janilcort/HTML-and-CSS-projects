<p>Here is the history of how Garage sales started</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.qualityovhd.com/new-blog/the-history-of-garages-and-garage-sales">
Garage sales started as branching out of ‘rommage,’, which was a discount sale of unclaimed cargo at the shipyards in the early 1800’s. As time progressed, similar sales became popular in social hubs such as churches. Finally, in the 50’s and 60’s, yard sales grew to be family and neighborhood events.
